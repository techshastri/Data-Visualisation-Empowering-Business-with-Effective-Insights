For the first Task you have to design four question for CMO and CEO.
Question for CEO
1. What do you want to achieve with this analysis in terms of revenue growth or operational efficiency?
2. What is the current financial health of the company in terms of profit margins, cash flow, and growth rate?
3. Are there specific regions or demographic segments where you'd like to focus expansion efforts?
4. What are the key industry trends (e.g., e-commerce growth, and supply chain disruptions) you are monitoring to shape future business strategies?

Questions for CMO
1. How effective are the current marketing platforms in driving customer acquisition and sales?
2. What steps should be taken to enhance brand value, and how do current customer engagement metrics align with these efforts?
3. How can AI tools (e.g., predictive analytics, and personalized marketing) be leveraged to improve campaign effectiveness?
4. What types of partnerships or collaborations (e.g., influencers, cross-promotions) have historically performed well, and where can we expand further?
